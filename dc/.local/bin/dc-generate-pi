# compute and print decimal of pi

# An implementation of the Chudnovsky algorithm in the programming language dc.
# The program will print better and better approximations as it runs. But as pi
# is a transcendental number, the program will continue until interrupted or
# resource exhaustion of the machine it is run on.

# A fast divide and conquer implementation of the same formula that doubles in
# size each iteration. It evaluates a finite number if sums as an exact rational
# number and only performs one large division and square root per iteration. It
# is fast, but will still quickly slow down as the size of the fraction
# increases.
