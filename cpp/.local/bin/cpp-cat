# Usage: $0 [CPP_ARGS]... [C_FILE]

# Expands the given C source file with the preprocessor,
# except that it does expand/include the C standard headers.
#
# This is useful to preview how macros expands in our own files
# without all stuff from the standard header file.
#
# Hint: You might also find useful the -C option from cpp,
#       which prevent discarding of comments.


# use `cpp`, the C preprocessor, with mock headers:
cpp -nostdinc -P                         \
    -I"$(etc-home)"/cpp/_/mock_c_headers \
    -DINCLUDE_STANDARD_C_HEADER=#include \
    "$@"
    # -P         no #linemarkers
    # -nostdinc  don't search the standard system directories for header files.
    #            IS THIS NEEDED AT ALL ?
