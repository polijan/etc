# mpv in terminal with text output

# We use 'mpv --vo=tct' and here's the relevant piece from the mpv man page:
#
# tct    Color Unicode art video output driver that works on a text  console.
#        Depends  on support of true color by modern terminals to display the
#        images at full color range.  On Windows it requires an ansi terminal
#        such as mintty.
#
#        --vo-tct-algo=<algo>
#               Select how to write the pixels to the terminal.
#
#               half-blocks
#                      Uses unicode LOWER HALF BLOCK character to achieve
#                      higher vertical resolution. (Default.)
#
#               plain  Uses spaces. Causes vertical  resolution  to  drop
#                      twofolds, but in theory works in more places.
#
#        --vo-tct-width=<width> --vo-tct-height=<height>
#               Assume  the  terminal  has  the specified character width
#               and/or height.  These default to 80x25  if  the  terminal
#               size cannot be determined.
#
#        --vo-tct-256=<yes|no> (default: no)
#               Use  256  colors - for terminals which don't support true
#               color.
