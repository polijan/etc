Miscellaneous scripts, wrappers, and configuration files
for commands and programs I may use.


To bootstrap a new machine
--------------------------

Make sure git(1) is installed, then:

1) # getting 'etc'
   $ git clone https://github.com/polijan/etc.git

2) # create my "base" directories
   $ ./etc/etc-mkdirs


After that and after installing some known programs
---------------------------------------------------

Deployement of 'etc' content into the home directory is best
managed by the 'etc-stow' script, which is powered by GNU stow.
So make sure GNU stow is installed, then:

1) # deploy the config as symlinks into ~
   $ ~/PATH/TO/etc/etc-stow -R
   (solve the stow conflicts, if any)

2) # reload your shell (as there might be new aliases, ...)
   $ exec $SHELL -l
