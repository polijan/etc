# Usage: cat+ FILE
#        cat+ [CAT_OPTION]... [FILE]...
#
# When stdin and stdout are opened on a terminal and cat+ is called with only
# one (existing, readable) FILE, then this file will be displayed using
# less(1). In any other case, cat+ just invokes the cat(1) command.


# In an interactive shell, cat may be used to display the file on screen
# thus when cat is only invoked with a filename from and to a terminal,
# I invoke less instead. less is called so that it displays on the terminal
# and exit if file can be displayed on one screen
