# Disable and then re-enable the swap (pages will be swapped back to RAM)
#
# Linux manages swap properly, so in general there's no need to do this.
# But it can be used to know to make the system will be responsive.
#
# IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO HAVE ENOUGH FREE RAM (MORE THAN THE SWAP) TO DO THIS,
#            OTHERWISE THE SYSTEM WILL START KILLING PROCESSES ARBITRARILY.
